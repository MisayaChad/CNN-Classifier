# CNN-Classifier
An image classifier base on tensorflow

# NOTE: this's a project in development!!! So don't launch until I remove this line!

# for some reason I won't upload my datasets, and later I will write a image processer

## CNN Architecture

input layer => conv layer1 => max pool layer1 => conv layer2 => maxpool layer2 => fc(fully connected) layer => softmax => output layer

## Quick Start

### Install packages

sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
